    <h3>TIMELINE</h3>

  <nav class="timeline">
    <p> <span>1979</span> “It’s Japan’s northernmost prefecture, so there’s not much going on. But my father loved driving fast, so I became obsessed with the sensation of speed and started tinkering with cars. I bought my first when I was 15 years old – a Mitsubishi Galant GTO. But I struggled to fix it, so a local boss at Toyota helped me get it running. When we did, I started driving it to school. But, being only 16, it was illegal. So when the teachers found out, I was expelled.” </p>
    <p> <span>1985</span> Tuners went properly crackers at this time, uncorking them to see how fast they’d go. It compounded in a near-pathological obsession with speed. Zero-300kph run times at Yatabe’s oval proving ground became most valuable currency in the scene. Then, with the connection of new, free-running motorways, top speed runs started spilling out onto the streets, specifically the Aqua-Line, a 9.6km tunnel underneath Tokyo Bay that late at night would become Smokey’s subterranean test track.</p>
    <p> <span>1990</span> Just wanting to be the fastest, Smokey’s always been brand agnostic and often mixes a cocktail of different manufacturers’ components to make Frankenstein, bright gold (winners only get gold, see) vmax machines. Over the years, he’s been through every generation of GT-R, with an R32 being Top Secret’s first. Later, his R33 Skyline GT-R managed 0–300kph in 17 seconds at Yatabe and 204mph in the tunnel, arguably the kernel of the idea of the A1(M) run.</p>
    <p> <span>1998</span> Hence a day of burnouts anywhere he could; next to a field of cows, on a busy roundabout and, eventually, in the middle of the A1(M), just before the 194mph run. “I did what I did, and what happened happened. I know it’s morally wrong, but it is what it is. I got sent to the police station but, not speaking any English, I had to wait in a cell until I could get a lawyer and a translator and go to court. I admitted to doing 120mph and was banned from the UK for 10 years, had a one-month international license suspension, a £155 fine and £35 court fees. I was lucky; I thought I was going to prison. I returned to my hotel and there were paparazzi and press everywhere, so I sneaked out the back door to the airport. I was worried all the way until take-off where I thought, ‘I’m free – banzai!’”</p>
